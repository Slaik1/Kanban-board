# Kanban Board
## _Website for delegating tasks_
- The Kanban board is a tool for workflow visualization, designed to help you bring clarity to your work process and enhance efficiency by limiting work in progress. 
- You can drag and drop tasks between panels, the panels themselves, and tasks inside the panel.

## Tech

- HTML

- JS 
- Json Server
- Mock Api

## Installation

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

## BTW

You can check [Kanban Board](https://slaik1.github.io/Kanban-board/) on GitHub Pages where I use moke API.
Mocke Api servers is not so good, that's why you should check Kanban Board locally.
